I"ù<p>A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production.[1] The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The word in the sense of an agricultural land-holding derives from the verb ‚Äúto farm‚Äù a revenue source, whether taxes, customs, rents of a group of manors or simply to hold an individual manor by the feudal land tenure of ‚Äúfee farm‚Äù. The word is from the medieval Latin noun firma, also the source of the French word ferme, meaning a fixed agreement, contract,[2] from the classical Latin adjective firmus meaning strong, stout, firm.[3][4] As in the medieval age virtually all manors were engaged in the business of agriculture, which was their principal revenue source, so to hold a manor by the tenure of ‚Äúfee farm‚Äù became synonymous with the practice of agriculture itself.</p>

<p>Modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized. In the United States, livestock may be raised on rangeland and finished in feedlots and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number of agricultural workers needed. In Europe, traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units. In Australia, some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock because of climatic conditions. In less developed countries, small farms are the norm, and the majority of rural residents are subsistence farmers, feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market.</p>
